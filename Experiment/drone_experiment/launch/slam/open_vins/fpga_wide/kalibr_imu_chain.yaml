  # three different modes supported:
  # "calibrated" (same as "kalibr"), "kalibr", "rpng"
  # "kalibr" contains Dw6^T, Da6^T, R_IMUtoGYRO and Tg9
  # "rpng" contains Dw6, Da6, R_IMUtoACC, Tg9, where D_6 are up-triangular matrices
  model: "kalibr"
  # how to get from Kalibr imu.yaml result file:
  #   - Tw is Dw^{-1} imu0:gyroscopes:M:
  #   - R_IMUtoGYRO: is imu0:gyroscopes:C_gyro_i:
  #   - Ta is Da^{-1} imu0:accelerometers:M:
  #   - R_IMUtoACC not used by Kalibr, set as Identical since the base inertial frame must coincide with one
  #   - Tg is imu0:gyroscopes:A:
